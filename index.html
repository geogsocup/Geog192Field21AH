					Tabaco City is an interesting subject because it is a city that, as of the 2020 census, is populated by around 140, 691 people residing in a city with an area of 117.14 km2. The city itself has parts that can be considered urban and others that can be considered as rural, holding territory containing an urban center based around a port and rural outskirts of fields near volcanic slopes and an entire separate island.
				</span>
				<br>
				<br>
				<span>
					Tabaco City is located on the northeastern coast of Albay Province, 13°19'20" North Latitude and 123°39'47" East Longitude. The city is about 455 kilometers from Manila and 25 kilometers from the provincial capital, Legazpi City. The city is bounded by the Municipality of Malinao on the north, the Municipality of Malilipot on the south, the City of Ligao, Municipalities of Oas and Polangui on the west and Lagonoy Gulf on the east. A large part of the city is located in the mainland. The island of San Miguel, located a few kilometers offshore, is also under the jurisdiction of the City. The city is made up of 47 barangays.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="cls2 pos-abs good-item">
				<span>
					40 folk healers were interviewed spread out over the 23 barangays of Tabaco City, Albay. Semi-structured interview was used as a data-gathering tool carried out over-the-phone with limited on-ground assistance. The interview was guided by an outline asking the folk healers of their treatment methodologies, practices, materials and tools, clients, payments, relations with modern health care as well as their prospects in the practice, among others.
				</span>
				<br>
				<br>
				<span>
					While folk healing has been widely documented in literature, Tabaco City is a scale not yet tackled. Thus, the research was conducted to explore how Tabaco City folk healers reinforce certain generalizations in the practice as well as look into the possibilities this unique form of health provision can help in revolutionizing the public healthcare system. The map above shows the distribution of the 40 folk healer informants in the city of Tabaco.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="cls3 pos-abs good-item">
				<span>
					The map above showcases the sex of the folk healer informants. Evidently, 33 of the informants are female while 8 are male; most of the traditional healers are female, and only a small portion are male. This aligns with the non-patriarchal precolonial history of the country wherein the babaylans became specialists in culture, medicine, and religion. And surprisingly the babaylans are mostly female or effeminate. Aside from this historical component foreshadowed in the alternative healers, the gender stereotype to a Filipina is that she is “modest, refined, demure, nurturing, sweet, clean, affectionate, generous and sensitive,” characters that should be present especially when tending to the sick. Our traditional healers therefore are sought for because they have historical and discursive legitimacy. By being females, they effectively engender the role of being a traditional healer, and it is through history and construction that they become the most appropriate face of a healer.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="cls4 pos-abs good-item">
				<span>
					Age is a relevant information to highlight in the practice as it can give us insights in the futures and possibilities in folk healing. The map illustrates this information and attests to the aging sample of folk healers as a good majority register an age above 55 years old.  The most observable age among the healers is 67 garnering 10%. Meanwhile, the youngest healer is 39 years old, whereas the oldest is 86. Thereupon, 13 (32.5%) of the healers were aged between 61 to 70 years old, during the time they were interviewed. 
				</span>
				<br>
				<br>
				<span>
					This is worrying as it means this form of healthcare is a dying one as it pools an aging sample. Intervention is needed to thrust the youth in this practice to ensure a continued legacy. Without this assistance, the enthusiasm of our folk healer informants to pass on the practice will be neglected and wasted if no one is ready and willing to receive it.
				</span>

				<span>
					Six categories were constructed to classify the folk healer informants of Tabaco City, Albay. These categories include hilot, tambal, albularyo or herbolario, faith healer, as well as “mixed healer” for those who utilize overlapping methodologies and “others” for those whose methodologies do not fit into the categories made.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="cls6 pos-abs good-item">
				<span>
					<strong>Hilot</strong> - The word hilot, which means “massage”, describes succinctly what these types of folk healers are and what they do. A hilot primarily uses massages to treat physical injuries like wounds and sprains, and also common ailments like coughs and fevers. Some hilot also supplement their massages with oils, herbal remedies, and rituals and prayers to ensure that their clients recover.
				</span>
				<br>
				<br>
				<span>
					<strong>Albularyo</strong> - The word albularyo is derived from the Spanish word herbolario, which means herbalist. In the Philippine context, an albularyo is a traditional healing practitioner that goes beyond herbalism, also employing spiritual and supernatural methods to treat and ward off ailments. In this paper, albularyos are set apart from other types of healers because of the supernatural source of their abilities. While they employ methods used by other types of healers, such as herbalism, hilot, and tawas, albularyos are unique in that they claim to have personally received their abilities from spirits, unseen voices, or other supernatural sources, and the type of healing they administer would depend on advice given by these sources.
				</span>
				<br>
				<br>
				<span>
					<strong>Tambal</strong> - The word tambal, from “pagtatambal” which means “to heal” is generally used in other parts of the Philippines interchangeably with the word albularyo. Because of the local usage of the word in Tabaco City, however, we use the word tambal in this paper to describe folk healers that primarily employ herbs and ointments to create poultices that treat wounds and animal bites, particularly that of insects and venomous snakes. In a way similar to the hilot, the tambal may also supplement their healing practices with massages, prayers, and rituals. 
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="cls7 pos-abs good-item">
				<span>
					To analyze the spatial distribution of the folk healers in Tabaco City, the 23 barangays were grouped into four categories, namely: upland, suburban, island, and poblacion. The suburban barangays of Bangkilingan, Baranghawon, Bognabong, Cobo, Panal, Pawa, Salvacion, San Lorenzo, and San Vicente had the most number of healers at 18 (45%). The healers are mostly faith healers and manghihilots who also administer faith healing by 33.3%. The upland barangays of Basagan, Bonot, Buang, Buhian, Comon, Mariroc, Oras, Pinagbobong, San Antonio, and Tabiguian had the second highest number of healers at 17 (42.5%). It has only four male healers interviewed and are dominantly influenced by mixed healers of faith healing and hilot at about 29%. Four (10%) of the healers are from the island barangays of Saguirang and Hacienda, and three of them are manghihilots. Lastly, there was only one healer interviewed, a female mixed healer of hilot and tambal, from the poblacion barangay of Tayhi.
				</span>
				<br>
				<br>
				<span>
					The suburban, island, and upland barangays can be reduced into one classification: the rural. A wide literature had already assumed that traditional healing is a practice common in rural areas, especially those far-flung from the city, and our sample’s location adds up to this conclusion. 
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="cls8 pos-abs good-item">
				<span>
					Poverty is worse off in rural areas than in urban areas. And since the cost of health factors highly in the health-seeking behavior of Filipinos with illnesses, it is therefore only judicious that the most affordable form of health care exists most prominently in rural areas. The location of the traditional healers in rural areas therefore is not just due to the ideological difference between the urban and the rural but is also due to the economic inequality between the two. Alternative healing in rural areas ultimately is an effort to provide an alternative to conventional medical treatment that is cheap and for the poor. 
				</span>
				<br>
				<br>
				<span>
					The ideological difference between urban and rural may also be the reason why there is a prevalence of folk healing in the rural. The urban being the face of modernity and rural tradition. This reveals so much on how the rural became a cultivating environment and a safe haven for culture and tradition to survive without discrimination. And since traditional healing is very much cultural and, of course, traditional, nowhere can it find its home better than in the rural where it is accepted as part and parcel of life. We can see how this is as traditional medicine moors cures and causes of diseases on the supernatural existing in nature. And between rural and urban, it is in rural areas that people have a close interconnection with the environment as almost all activities are highly dependent on nature and the land. It is in the rural that the different herbal medicines exist, and it is also in this setting that the supernatural and spectres are imagined. Therefore, the way rural people reimagine its space into a dual one and attach life to nature provided the most suitable ground for the seeds of traditional medicine to grow.

					Major hospitals, as in the case of Tabaco, also tend to be located in the city and urban areas. Thus, alternative medicine becomes truly alternative by locating in areas that modern health care cannot reach, as in rural areas.This map shows the distribution of our alternative healers alongside the distribution of our healthcare units, and this illustration suggests that while alternative healers are clustered, Tabaco City’s health care units are inclined to concentrated in one area, especially in the poblacion. This skews the accessibility of healthcare.

				<br>
				<span>
					More than accessibility, an interesting facet to point out here is that even though healthcare units become accessible in tends of location, it could be that they cannot be accessible in some other respects. It could be because they tend to scare people away due to their abstruse character, their expensiveness, or systemic failure such as lack of resources and personnels. Thus, as much as this map shows how alternative medicine is in contrast with modern medicine, it also goes to show what more can be learned from our folk healers.
