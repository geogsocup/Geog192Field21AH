					As of the 2020 Census, Tabaco City has 140, 691 people residing in a city with an area of 117.14 km2. While it is a fourth class component city, Tabaco has only a small  urban core (poblacion) composed of its international port, government center, and commercial area. Beyond this zone, its other mainland barangays  have a more rural and agricultural environment. This includes cultivated fields and coconut lands from the city’s mid and upland barangays that extends to those communities near Mayon’s slopes.  Moreover, the six barangays of San Miguel Island are all rural settlements.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="cls2 pos-abs good-item">
				<span>
					Tabaco City is located on the northeastern coast of Albay Province, 13°19'20" North Latitude and 123°39'47" East Longitude. The city is about 455 kilometers from Manila and 25 kilometers from the provincial capital, Legazpi City. The city is bounded by the Municipality of Malinao on the north, the Municipality of Malilipot on the south, the City of Ligao, Municipalities of Oas and Polangui on the west and Lagonoy Gulf on the east. A large part of the city is located in the mainland. The island of San Miguel, located a few kilometers offshore, is also under the jurisdiction of the City. The city is made up of 47 barangays.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="cls3 pos-abs good-item">

					40 folk healers were interviewed spread out over the 23 barangays of Tabaco City, Albay. Semi-structured interview was used as a data-gathering tool carried out over-the-phone with limited on-ground assistance. The interview was guided by an outline asking the folk healers of their treatment methodologies, practices, materials and tools, clients, payments, relations with modern health care as well as their prospects in the practice, among others. <br><br>While folk healing has been widely documented in literature, Tabaco City is a scale not yet tackled. Thus, the research was conducted to explore how Tabaco City folk healers reinforce certain generalizations in the practice as well as look into the possibilities this unique form of health provision can help in revolutionizing the public healthcare system. The map above shows the distribution of the 40 folk healer informants in the city of Tabaco.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="cls5 pos-abs good-item">
				<span>
					The map illustrates the sex-composition of the folk healer informants. Thirty-three of the informants are female, while only eight are male. This aligns with the non-patriarchal precolonial history of the country wherein the babaylans were specialists and leaders in medicine and religion. It should be noted babaylans are mostly female or effeminate. Aside from historically serving as traditional healers and spiritual leaders, ideal women in Philippine society are considered as affectionate, gentle, and nurturing characters who are expected to tend to the sick. <br><br>Our female traditional healers, therefore, are sought after, in part, because they have historical and traditional legitimacy. By being females, they effectively engender the role of being a nurturer, and, through history and cultural construction, they have become the most appropriate face of a healer.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="cls7 pos-abs good-item">
				<span>
					The current age of our Tabaco’s  healers can give us insights on the future possibilities and challenges of folk healing in the city. The map, in fact, further  emphasizes the reality that Tabaco’s folk healers, majority of whom are above 55 years old, are an ageing group. In fact, one out of every 10 healers are already 67-years-old. Meanwhile, the youngest healer is almost pushing middle age at 39 years old, whereas the oldest is 86. Thirteen  (32.5% of total) of the city’s  healers are between 61 to 70 years of age. <br> <br>This information means that, unless they are replaced by younger people, this form of healthcare is under threat of disappearing. Younger people should be encouraged to learn and master the skills of their healing elders in order to continue the legacy and service provided by the latter.
				</span>

					Tabaco City’s alternative healers were classified into six types. These categories include hilot, tambal, albularyo or herbolario, faith healer, as well as “mixed healer”- for those who utilize overlapping methodologies - and “others” for those whose methodologies do not fit into the aforementioned categories.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="cls10 pos-abs good-item">
				<span>
					<strong>Hilot</strong> - The word hilot, which means “to massage”, describes what these types of folk healers are and what they do. A hilot primarily uses massages to treat physical injuries like wounds and sprains, and also common ailments like coughs and fevers. Some hilot also supplement their massages with oils, herbal remedies, as well as rituals and prayers to ensure that their clients recover.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="cls11 pos-abs good-item">
				<span>
					<strong>Albularyo</strong> - The word albularyo is derived from the Spanish word herbolario, which means herbalist. In the Philippine context, an albularyo is a traditional healing practitioner that goes beyond herbalism, as he or she also employs spiritual and supernatural methods to treat and ward off ailments. In this paper, albularyos are set apart from other types of healers because of the supposed supernatural source of their abilities. While they employ methods used by other types of healers, such as herbalism, hilot, and tawas, albularyos are unique in that they claim to have personally received their abilities from spirits, unseen voices, or other supernatural sources. In addition, the type of healing they administer would depend on the advice given by these sources.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="cls12 pos-abs good-item">
				<span>
					<strong>Tambal</strong> - The word tambal, from “pagtatambal” which means “to heal” is generally used in other parts of the Philippines interchangeably with the word albularyo. Because of the local usage of the word in Tabaco City, however, we use the word tambal in this paper to describe folk healers that primarily employ herbs and ointments to create poultices that treat wounds and animal bites, particularly that of insects and venomous snakes. In a way similar to the hilot, the tambal may also supplement their healing practices with massages, prayers, and rituals. 
				</span>

				<span>
				In order to analyze the spatial distribution of the folk healers in Tabaco City, the 23 barangays were grouped into four categories, namely: upland, suburban, island, and poblacion. The suburban barangays of Bangkilingan, Baranghawon, Bognabong, Cobo, Panal, Pawa, Salvacion, San Lorenzo, and San Vicente had the most number of healers at 18 (45%). They are mostly faith healers and manghihilots who also administer faith healing (33.3%). The upland barangays of Basagan, Bonot, Buang, Buhian, Comon, Mariroc, Oras, Pinagbobong, San Antonio, and Tabiguian had the second highest number of healers at 17 (42.5%). It has only four male healers interviewed and are dominantly influenced by mixed healers of faith healing and hilot at about 29%. Four (10%) of the healers are from the island barangays of Saguirang and Hacienda, of which three are manghihilots. Lastly, there was only one healer interviewed, a female mixed healer of hilot and tambal, from the poblacion barangay of Tayhi.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="cls12 pos-abs good-item">
				<span>
					The suburban, island, and upland barangays can all be classified as rural areas. A wide literature already asserts that traditional healing is a practice common in rural areas, especially those far from the city, and our sample’s location corroborates with  this conclusion. 
				</span>
				<br>
				<br>
				<span>
					Poverty is worse off in rural areas than in urban areas. Since the cost of health services  factors heavily on the behavior of Filipinos with respect to illnesses, it is understandable that alternative forms of healthcare thrive in rural areas. The existence of traditional healers in rural areas is not just due to the ideological difference between the urban and the rural, but it is also due to the economic inequality between the two. Alternative healing in rural areas ultimately is an effort to provide an alternative to conventional medical treatment that is more affordable for the poor. 
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="cls11a pos-abs good-item">
				<span>
					Differences in beliefs and outlook between urban and rural inhabitants may also be the reason why there is a prevalence of folk healing in the latter areas. Urban settlements are considered the face of modernity, while rural areas are seen as places where tradition is maintained. This reveals much about how rural places have cultivated an environment and safe haven for culture and tradition to thrive. We can see this in how traditional medicine  cures and cause of disease as emanating from both the natural environment, in religion, and in the  supernatural. And between rural and urban areas, it is in the former that people have a close interconnection with the environment as almost all activities are highly dependent on nature and the land. It is in the rural that the different herbal medicines exist, and it is also in this setting that the supernatural is likely to be felt or  imagined. Therefore, the way rural people reimagine its space into a dual one and attach life to nature provide the most suitable ground for the seeds of traditional medicine to grow.

					Major hospitals, as in the case of Tabaco, also tend to be located in the city and urban areas. Thus, alternative medicine becomes truly alternative by locating in areas that modern health care cannot reach, as in rural areas.This map shows the distribution of our alternative healers alongside the distribution of our healthcare units, and this illustration suggests that while alternative healers are clustered, Tabaco City’s health care units are inclined to concentrated in one area, especially in the poblacion. This skews the accessibility of healthcare.

				<br>
				<br>
				<span>
					More than accessibility, an interesting facet to point out here is that even though healthcare units become accessible in tends of location, it could be that they cannot be accessible in some other respects. It could be because they tend to scare people away due to their abstruse character, their expensiveness, or systemic failure such as lack of resources and personnels. Thus, as much as this map shows how alternative medicine is in contrast with modern medicine, it also goes to show what more can be learned from our folk healers.
